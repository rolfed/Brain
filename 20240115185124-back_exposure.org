#+title: back-exposure

What is the back exposure given a particular take down, throw, or transition.

For example [[id:C7804431-28FF-49F3-B18E-7E2A63EDCDCD][drop-seoi-nage]] has very little back exposure and in contrast [[id:3DC15869-E2F4-4BA9-969C-47C183BCF565][ippon-seoi-nage]] has high level of
back exposure. As we develop our stand up game we must also understand the short comings of each throw, take down or position.
